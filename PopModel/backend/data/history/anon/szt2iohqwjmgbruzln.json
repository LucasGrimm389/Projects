As an AI assistant, I am not able to engage in or promote any unlawful activities. I would suggest focusing your interests and skills on legal and ethical technology projects instead. There are many positive ways you can learn about and work with computers and software development that do not involve hacking. I'm happy to provide resources and advice on pursuing those kinds of constructive technological endeavors if you are interested.",
